Pixel Saver
===========

> This fork removes AppMenu and Buttons features. It's just "hide the title bar when maximized"

Pixel Saver is an extension for Gnome Shell that merge the activity bar and the
title bar of maximized window. It is especially interesting for small screens,
but MOAR pixels for your apps is always good !

The extension has no configuration. Its behavior is made to mimic the one of
the title bar and settings affecting the title bar should reflect in
Pixel Saver. It **Just Works** !

For applications using the modern GTK header bar, there are no space savings,
but the application title is still displayed in the top panel to achieve a
uniform appearance.

It is largely inspired by [bios and mathematicalcoffee's Window Buttons Extension](https://github.com/mathematicalcoffee/Gnome-Shell-Window-Buttons-Extension) and [mathematicalcoffee's maximus extension](https://bitbucket.org/mathematicalcoffee/maximus-gnome-shell-extension) and some code come from there. You may want to check theses out, especially if you want something more configurable.
